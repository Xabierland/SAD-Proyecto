The service was good,Jayanta Biswas,2017-05-19,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Kolkata to San Francisco via Singapore. From Kolkata was an A330, good and comfortable. Food and drinks were served though it was a late night flight. Transit in Singapore was smooth. Changi is a nice airport to transit through. The second flight was on a A350-900 the so-called next-gen aircraft; but I didn't find it too comfortable. The service was good with an efficient crew. A simple amenity kit was provided and the washrooms also had the basic supplies. The food was good and sufficient. Snacks were available in the galley. However, I did not like the cramped seating of the A350. Arrival was smooth and on time.",Solo Leisure,April 2017,Singapore to San Francisco,Economy Class,5,4,5,1,5,8,yes
Two thumbs down,S Tarpen,2017-05-18,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to San Francisco. I previously had positive things to say about Singapore Airlines, but in this case, I was very frustrated. I paid extra for an upgraded seat with extra legroom. Instead, the seat was in front of the exit door and had less legroom. In addition, the TV was broken and so for the entire 16 hour flight, I could not watch any TV. Two thumbs down.",Business,April 2017,Hong Kong to Brisbane via Singapore,Premium Economy,5,2,4,4,1,1,no
disappointing travel experience,Gloria Cheng,2017-05-12,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Hong Kong to Brisbane via Singapore with Singapore Airline. It is a disappointing travel experience. The flight from Hong to Singapore (SQ871) was delayed about 30 minutes and therefore arrived Singapore 10 minutes later than scheduled. Yet my next flight from Singapore to Brisbane (SQ255) was going to depart in about 40 minutes. It was so a rush to transfer flight in such short period of time. A better arrangement would be appreciated as this pattern happens daily. As soon as I landed in Singapore, the staff informed me that my luggage could not get on the same flight as mine because of the time constraint and that I had to make a report after landing in Brisbane. However, no further detail was given and I was not sure where and who to talk to. The flight from Singapore to Brisbane is about 8 hours which would give their staff plenty of time to communicate between Singapore and Brisbane offices about my luggage. When I landed in Brisbane, I was directed to the office after asking a flight attendant and then the counter staff at departure. I would appreciate if I was given a better instruction in Singapore (or at least before landing) so that I would not need to run around in the airport. I told the lady at the office about my situation and showed her my flight tickets and passport. However, she did not check anything about my luggage and kept giving me confusing information. She told me my luggage should be in the baggage claim and I had to wait at the airport for an uncertain amount of time since I went through custom already and could not go back in anymore. Then she said the staff had paged me at baggage claim but I did not respond. However, I did not hear any announcement in baggage claim. When I asked her whether my luggage was in Brisbane or Singapore, she was not sure. I wouldâ€™ve appreciated if she could check for me before saying anything. I am not upset about my luggage not being able to get on my second flight but I'm deeply disappointed about the service and how the staff handled it. I will never take Singapore Airline or recommend to my family and friends.",Solo Leisure,April 2017,Dusseldorf to Hanoi via Singapore,Economy Class,4,4,2,4,1,1,no
truly pleasant flights,Markus Schroeder,2017-04-21,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Dusseldorf to Hanoi via Singapore. Both segments were truly pleasant flights. The check-in and boarding were well organized and quick. The cabin crews on both flights were very kind and helpful. On DUS-SIN they frequently served drinks, snacks and apples were available as well. I had the same excellent experience on SGN-SIN and SIN-DUS, so I would definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,Singapore to Amsterdam,Economy Class,4,4,5,5,5,10,yes
so welcomed by the crew,Henry LIm,2017-04-19,Singapore Airlines,False,Singapore to Amsterdam. I felt so welcomed by the crew. The flight attendants were helping and greeting passengers and bringing them to their seat and helped them putting away their hand luggage.  The meal service was very quick and efficient. Overall they flight was very pleasant and comfortable! The flight attendants did Singapore Airlines proud and showed why this airlines has one of the best crew service! I would recommend everybody to fly Singapore Airlines.,Solo Leisure,March 2017,Cape Town to Singapore,Economy Class,4,2,4,2,5,10,yes
Don't bother to help,Andrew Dutton,2017-04-19,Singapore Airlines,False,Cape Town to Singapore. Don't bother to hang your jacket. Don't bother to help open up your bedding but one has to struggle with it oneself. Rude interaction. Don't bother to help with opening the table for meals. Often forget to offer some passengers cheese and fruit when it is standard for all business class. Poor lounge food choice with only Indian food available to eat. Don't allow couples to travel together.,Couple Leisure,March 2017,Istanbul to Singapore,Business Class,5,5,5,4,2,1,no
consider to fly again with Singapore,M Pakalis,2017-04-19,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Istanbul to Singapore. Best cabin crew experience, and very helpful during the 10 hour flight. Served frequently snacks and drinks.  I personaly congratulated chief of cabin crew, who didn't stop to serve passengers during the whole flight. I will seriously consider to fly again with Singapore.",Solo Leisure,April 2017,Singapore to Bangkok,Economy Class,4,4,4,5,5,9,yes
it was 5 star flight,T Matryev,2017-04-13,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Singapore to Bangkok. It was a very pleasant flight, no delay, quick and effective service at fantastic Singapore airport. Although the flight was almost full the services on board were well organized. Of course I should mention wonderful air hostess. They looked like top models.  Overall it was 5 star flight.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,Jakarta to Singapore,Economy Class,5,5,4,4,5,9,yes
gracious and much appreciated act,T Tawapandi,2017-04-07,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Jakarta to Singapore. Exemplary customer service experience from Garuda and Singapore Airlines. Our flight scheduled to depart at 15:20 from Pontianak to Jakarta on 27 March, was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather (heavy thunderstorm). We missed our connecting flight scheduled to depart at 19:00 from Jakarta to Singapore. Upon arrival in Jakarta we brought our case to Garuda customer service and it was promptly processed. There's no flight available for the day so we were put in hotel with dinner and breakfast voucher. The next day Garuda customer service staff went to Singapore Airlines office and they were able to release 2 tickets for us to fly back to Singapore on that day. A gracious and much appreciated act from Garuda and Singapore Air. Thank you!",Couple Leisure,March 2017,Singapore to Mumbai,Economy Class,2,3,1,4,4,9,yes
didn't feel worth the premium,V Nelson,2017-04-05,Singapore Airlines,True,My experience with Singapore Airlines was decent at best. The airline fails to compare to the Middle East carriers such as Emirates. My Singapore to Mumbai journey was in an old 777 with a very uncomfortable seat that left me with a backache. The entertainment system on both the 777 and A380 were archaic and cumbersome to use. Definitely didn't feel worth the premium price that I paid for the ticket.,Solo Leisure,March 2017,SFO to SIN via HKG,Economy Class,4,1,4,4,2,4,no
lounge staff were very courteous,Rosalia Da Garcia,2017-03-27,Singapore Airlines,False,San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong. Beautiful seats with such comfort. Sufficient storage space. If you long for Singapore cuisine there is tons on board. Whilst I did not eat the crew reserved a banana for me before we landed. The SFO-HKG was uneventful as the crew were kind switched off the lights early allowing us to sleep.  The HKG-SIN sector departed on time and the HKG ground crew and lounge staff were very courteous attending to any questions I had about my allergies. The crew was quick to get us our drinks and meals and then we settled to do our work or watch a movie. My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKG-SIN as apparently the networks are not that great. This will be very helpful.,Business,March 2017,Singapore to San Francisco,Business Class,5,4,5,5,5,9,yes
A350 seats were somewhat closer,Rosalia Da Garcia,2017-03-27,Singapore Airlines,False,Singapore to San Francisco. The A350 seats were somewhat closer than the Boeing 777. The seats has the length but does not appear to be as wide. The toilet is very cool with state of the art flushing etc. Normally I am able to sleep well on board but maybe because it is a day flight I suffered from jet lag later in the week. Crew was excellent and attentive to our needs and there were loads of request for food by my fellow passengers.,Business,March 2017,Brisbane to Singapore,Business Class,3,5,5,5,4,7,yes
a very enjoyable trip,N Elder,2017-03-25,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Brisbane to Singapore. This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats.",Couple Leisure,February 2017,San Francisco to Singapore,Business Class,2,5,5,1,5,8,yes
nothing was offered voluntarily,M Kitts,2017-03-24,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Flew roundtrip on Singapore Airlines new nonstop route between San Francisco and Singapore in Premium Economy on the outbound and regular Coach class upon returning. The premium seat was decent, but I wasn't as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. With the hard partition toward business class in front, and the service area / galley located well to the rear past an economy section, the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual dead-end rarely patrolled by flight attendants. On the SFO-SIN sector, received two meals during the 16h20m flight, with no other proactive service - no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. You had to press the call button for anything, mid-flight snacks were available but again, nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself, the service on the return flight SIN-SFO in regular Economy was actually better, with a pre-lunch drinks run (from a tray, not a full cart) and follow-up hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight, however, the second meal service - a breakfast - took place about six hours before landing, what gives? The check-in experience at SFO was ok, but at SIN economy passengers are herded toward self check-in kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. I have only flown SIA once before, but based on my limited experience with them so far, I wouldn't go out of my way to fly them - although I would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,Sydney to Colombo via Singapore,Premium Economy,5,3,4,3,4,6,yes
cabin crew seemed almost robotic,P Hughes,2017-03-23,Singapore Airlines,True,"  First time with Singapore Airlines. Got to Sydney airport early. Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didn't and couldn't fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didn't bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota. Same continued on SIN-CMB leg except seat had lumbar support this time, didn't turn on entertainment system this time. I think SQ is highly overrated and not a patch on Emirates or even some non 5 star airlines. Would consider others before SQ next time.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,Bangkok to Seoul via Singapore,Economy Class,2,4,5,5,4,5,no
comfortable with lots of storage space,S Miller,2017-03-22,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Bangkok to Seoul via Singapore in business class. Checkin in BKK efficient, fast track security and immigration took less than 10 min. SQ lounge in BKK efficient. Flight comfortable with decent food. Singapore Changi lounge good, with decent food and drinks. Long flight to Seoul with new business class seat. Seat very comfortable with lots of storage space and good IFE. Food was of poor quality and quantity. This was for sure the worst ever business class meal ever. I pre-ordered the ""Signature"" lobster thermidor. It was awful. Small overbooked pieces of lobster swimming in butter on a lobster shell. Served with limb overcooked asparagus. The breakfast wasn't any better. I like SQ because of its great service, but the food served on this sector will let me think twice before booking SQ again.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,London to Singapore,Business Class,2,5,5,4,3,5,yes
the service is great,A Cole,2017-03-20,Singapore Airlines,False,"  SQ 305 from LHR to SIN onboard Singapore Air's Boeing 777 four class cabin was one of the best long haul in economy flights I've endured. The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than I've seen on BA business 747. Overall the most comfy and best way to fly direct to Singapore from London in economy class but price will still dictate choices and whilst I'd pay a small Premium to fly Singapore again a harder discount from BA or Garuda would sway me.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,Singapore to Paris,Economy Class,2,5,1,2,4,10,yes
Excellent staff service,O Ruache,2017-03-11,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to Paris. Excellent staff service. Thank, once again, to cabin crew who provided excellent service during the flight,and were always smiling, patient, prompt and helpful. The food and beverage was satisfied. Thank, also, to pilots for so sweet landing in Parisian fog.",Solo Leisure,March 2017,Sydney to Singapore,Economy Class,4,4,4,2,5,10,yes
not travel Singapore Airlines in future,Francis Nath,2017-03-10,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Sydney to Singapore. We are very disappointed that we arrived 5 hours before the departure to get seats in row 30's and we were told its all full. As we are older people in early 70's. We were told we should select our seats by Internet. We checked 48hrs before departure online however all seats were allocated, the seats available were the same seats open 48hrs ago. What a shame that airline has no remorse to senior people. We are seating in toilet class row 56's. As seniors we make two or three trips a year however we haven't encountered this situation in our travelling time. Manager was not considerate or seriously shown any interest. Remember sorry does not make pain go away. I will advise the all the family and friends not to travel Singapore Airlines in future.",Couple Leisure,March 2017,Dubai to Penang via Singapore,Economy Class,4,5,5,4,3,3,no
use the old luggage,K Lee,2017-03-06,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Dubai to Singapore via Penang. First time fly with Singapore Airlines and will be final. I thought everything is perfect not until when I received my new luggage, with the Protection cover missing and the pocket zip is broken. When I file a complaint to Customer service, and the response is that it is due to the luggage is wear and tear, Singapore Airlines could not submit the damage claim to the insurance company and that's it. My conclusion, Singapore Airlines is very irresponsible, if you want to fly with them please ensure your luggage is wrapped or use the old luggage.",Solo Leisure,January 2017,Singapore to London,Economy Class,5,1,4,3,2,1,no
expensive airline with a lot of online hype,M Drew,2017-03-05,Singapore Airlines,False,"  My wife and I thought we would treat ourselves to Premium Economy on a recent holiday to Southeast Asia on both the main legs, London to and from Singapore. We usually fly BA premium economy, but this was part of a package and we upgraded the flight. We are in our 70's and cannot cope with economy over 13 hours To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. The only good thing is the seat but the service is very poor. Firstly if you ""Book the Cook "" a pre-ordered meal, it will be served long before anyone else. The promised champagne and drinks service did not materialise and staff did not curtain off the cabin from economy and were constantly moving through the cabin to serve economy passengers. This is an expensive airline with a lot of online hype about the premium economy service. We were allocated Row 31 which has extra legroom but as the seat plan shows it is right next to the galley and we were constantly disturbed throughout the whole flight. Under no circumstances would I use this cabin again - not a patch on BA",Couple Leisure,February 2017,Singapore to Sydney,Premium Economy,3,4,1,4,1,5,no
flight has no WiFi,D Roberts,2017-03-05,Singapore Airlines,True,Singapore to Sydney. I always fly Singapore Airlines as it offers the most direct flights out of Singapore. Flew on SQ241 on Feb 8th. SQ advises that all their SQ flights with B777-300ER and A350/380 has wi-fi. Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry. I can understand that most of the passengers are doing a transit but there are many of us who are just starting our day and with a flight at 0700 there is not much time for breakfast. I would appreciate if SQ indicate clearly which flights have wifi and not a blanket statement about the aircraft.,Business,February 2017,Singapore to Bangkok,Business Class,3,5,1,5,4,6,yes
always consider flying with them,G Lorenesta,2017-03-02,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Flew Singapore Airlines for a family vacation to Bangkok from Singapore. Everything was a breeze from online check-in to boarding and deplaning. The aircraft was clean and tidy. The cabin crew were attentive to passenger needs. The meal was delicious and sufficient enough. Before take off, the crews distribute hot towels to passengers so you can freshen up. The flight was smooth including landing. Inflight entertainment is great as there are so many choices of movies or music to listen to. Singapore Airlines is a great airline and I would always consider flying with them. During seat sale, they offer fares that are even cheaper than low-cost carrier. With Singapore Airlines you have meals and free luggage allowance of up to 30 kgs.",Family Leisure,June 2016,Manila to Hong Kong via Singapore,Economy Class,4,4,3,2,5,10,yes
Food is good and generous,J Gressan,2017-03-01,Singapore Airlines,False,Manila to Hong Kong via Singapore. Excellent service from their staff. Food is good and generous it's hard to beat. Singapore Airlines innovates and tries further to give better service to their customers. Plane feels a bit old already but facilities and amenities are well appointed.,Solo Leisure,February 2017,Singapore to Munich,Economy Class,5,4,4,5,5,10,yes
Service lacked enthusiasm,Viral Ladhani,2017-02-28,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to Munich, and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didn't see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it, I do recommend Singapore Airlines. I hope SIA will rectify the crew issue on this segment and hear the plight in catering segment for Premium Economy on all segments.",Business,March 2016,Singapore to Mumbai,Premium Economy,2,5,4,2,3,6,yes
very happy with the service,S Hishah,2017-02-28,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore. My recent journey with Singapore Airlines was really great, the crew was friendly and helpful.  Me and wife were traveling with 1 year old baby and we felt like one of the staff was appointed specially to us. We are very happy with the service. Thank you Singapore Airlines. I would give 10/10 for service, but I have to give only 7/10 for flight as it was very old and noisy flight .",Family Leisure,February 2017,ICN to MEL via SIN,Economy Class,5,4,5,4,4,7,yes
really comfortable and spacious,V Naidoo,2017-02-25,Singapore Airlines,True,Seoul to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Both sectors of this trip were fantastic. I rated all aspects of the flight experience very highly. Starting from the smooth check-in to the high quality food served at the lounges to the care from the flight crew. The meals were very good especially when the 'Book the chef' option is used. It's worth noting that the business class suites on the Boeing 777-300ER was newer than the ones on A380-800 but despite having a few more features (incl. newer AVOD and more storage compartments) both were really comfortable and spacious.,Business,January 2017,Singapore to New York via Frankfurt,Business Class,5,5,3,5,4,9,yes
generous seat width,J Choo,2017-02-24,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to New York via Frankfurt. I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQ's crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passenger's immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bin's lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I can't wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated.",Solo Leisure,February 2017,London to Singapore,Economy Class,5,5,1,5,4,10,yes
all in all great hard product,S Vanson,2017-02-24,Singapore Airlines,True,"  London Heathrow to Singapore. Was expecting more but very good all the same. Never flown Singapore Airlines for some reason. Used the United Airlines lounge at LHR T2 as better facilities, great breakfast and bar. Boarding ontime. Boeing 777-300ER with new business but not that new now. Took row 11 bulkhead, feet forward as opposed to angle. Great space for Business class with 1-2-1 seating. Far bigger than British Airways F seats. First Cabin of business only 3 rows so intimate. Being an early morning service brunch was served. A little too quickly for my liking virtually immediately after levelling out. Preordered book the cook Lobster , very good. Service and quality of food excellent. Cabin staff attentive if a little sterile. My TV system wouldn't work for a few hours. Crew tried hard to rectify and offered to move our seats. FInally got it working all ok. Flight services director appeared later with a SGD200 voucher for the inconvenience. That is good customer service. Slept for 4 hours. Breakfast prior arrival SIN good, arrived early. All in all great hard product, good food and service.",Couple Leisure,February 2017,Dusseldorf to Singapore,Business Class,3,2,3,2,4,8,yes
my best flight ever,Viral Ladhani,2017-02-22,Singapore Airlines,True,"  From boarding in Dusseldorf to reaching Changi, everything went smooth. We were greeted by professional well-presented crew.  Upon reach my seat in Premium Economy I wanted to take photo of my seat, where a cabin crew delightfully approached if she can take a picture for me while sitting and said ""it is great to have you on-board Sir and I would like to assure that your special meal is loaded"". We left DUS in time. The service followed with hot towel, drinks and nuts and meals. Using book the cook service means getting your meal before your fellow passengers. The meal was okay and we were offered three choices of warm bread and big selection of fancy drinks. After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests. I walked to see economy class, the crew were happy to chat about A350 product.  The aircraft by itself is very quiet, quieter than B787 and toilets are spaciously planned and were kept clean. The air ventilation can be really felt and cabin design made me feel relaxed. The Captain announced turbulence, and crew walked through the cabin to ensure we have fastened seatbelts. Before landing, breakfast was served and immigration cards handed out. We landed in time and I left the aircraft as a happy passenger with a feeling that this was my best flight ever.",Business,July 2016,Singapore to London,Premium Economy,4,3,4,4,4,9,yes
didn't feel I got value-for-money,C Reagan,2017-02-20,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to London Heathrow. I've flown Singapore Airlines in Economy Class long haul several times and been satisfied. On this occasion I decided to opt for Premium Economy. I was flying from Auckland to London via Singapore but the first leg was on Air New Zealand, and I recommend their Premium Economy service. Singapore Airlines seats have a bit more space and legroom than Economy, and the in-flight entertainment screens are bigger, but otherwise everything was identical to Economy class. I'm a vegetarian and I had the exact same two meals I had in Economy class three weeks earlier, and I didn't enjoy them the first time around. My companion ordered the ""book the cook"" and his meals seemed better quality, but none of the available options were vegetarian. For the breakfast service they completely forgot to offer us a drink. The service was bored and impersonal throughout, the flight attendants were rushing around and didn't smile. The toilets are shared with Economy class. For sleeping I didn't find the seats significantly more comfortable than regular Economy and the fixed central console means you can't stretch out over any adjacent empty seats. That said I'm only 5'3"", my 6'1"" companion did appreciate the extra legroom. The entertainment selection is extensive and the noise cancelling headphones good. However, we were in the front bulkhead seats and the screens were set on the wall ahead of and were too high for comfortable viewing, there are also irritating advertisements ahead of each programme. All-in-all extremely disappointed, didn't feel I got value-for-money compared to regular Economy class. This experience has really put me off flying Singapore Airlines again.",Couple Leisure,February 2017,CPH to BNE via SIN,Premium Economy,2,5,5,5,1,2,no
food was not up to scratch,M Graham,2017-02-20,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Copenhagen to Brisbane via Singapore. SAS Lounge in CPN comfortable and food looked OK, was not sure re wine out of a tap and so left this alone. The only other alcohol in the Business Class lounge was beer. Flight left on time and crew started working down one side of the Business Class cabin almost immediately, the other side took substantially longer. In any case the crew were helpful, the food was fine and the seat comfortable. Wine was good and topped up. A short stay in the lounge at Changi T3 and then re-boarded the same plane at the same gate (different flight number). Crew still fine but food was not up to scratch, the steak was very overcooked to the point of being really tough. The vegetables were mush, I didn't eat much and the crew member asked if I wanted anything else but I went to sleep instead. Supper coming into Brisbane was better. Waited 25 minutes for one bag in BNE, the other didn't arrive. Filled in the details at the airport. Have not heard back, no one answers the baggage service phone although you can leave a message that no one responds to as well. Calling Singapore Airlines they give you the number for Menzies Aviation that you have already called, they also mentioned that they would call back but have not. The online bag track system has had the same message on it for 6 days. In all the standard here is not commensurate with the full business class fare paid. The main advantage of the flights was being able to sleep, arriving on time is good but not when you are without your luggage and the follow up is so poor.",Business,February 2017,Singapore to Munich,Business Class,4,5,5,4,2,3,no
a low level of enthusiasm,M Graham,2017-02-19,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to Munich. A recently renovated 777-300 was exceptionally comfortable and provided the basis for an excellent trip if only the crew had cared. All crew members were well presented as always but those serving my part of the cabin showed a low level of enthusiasm about their jobs. It started with a 40 minute wait for a glass of wine and water, there was a similar 40 minute wait for a coffee in the morning. Offered a regular meal as opposed to the special meal I had pre-ordered at both dinner and breakfast, indicated that they weren't paying much attention. Not called by name once, just ""sir"" with a half hearted apology at dinner re the offer of the initial meal and then when asked if I would like desert a pointed response to me when asking what it was, being told ""I have no idea, you ordered a special meal"". Dinner was very watery as I don't think that the water from the vegetables had been drained and so the gravy was more like a soup. Breakfast omelette was cold. After I asked for the regular cereal to be taken away, I think that they began heating the special meal I had ordered only at this point. When it was served 10 minutes later half of it was cold to the point of being refrigerated. Not offered water between meals, had to go to the galley each time. While not the fault of the airline, it was topped off by a nearly two hour wait at customs. There was no immigration officer at the ""crew only"" queue and the crew went through our queue so they were off long before the passengers. We were behind a very slow moving contingent of Air China passengers. By the time I got to the baggage so much time had elapsed our flight was no longer listed and had to go to the Lufthansa bag desk to find out which carousel to go to. Landed at about 6:00 am and was in a taxi at about 9:00 am, which is far too long. The slow processing on arrival in Munich reflected the poor quality of the whole experience. Luckily the seat was so comfortable I had slept really well.",Business,February 2017,Singapore to Bali,Business Class,5,2,3,3,2,3,no

While service is still consistent as it was for many years, nothing has changed and the food is everytime getting worse. I have flown Singapore Airlines in last 2 months a few times and the main courses offered I could not eat them and left them. No question asked of course.

never fly Singapore Airlines again,G Rease,2017-02-17,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Singapore to Jakarta return. I always had a good experience on Singapore Airlines, until December 4 and again December 8, 2016. I flew from Singapore to Jakarta and then back to Singapore. When I booked, I gave SIA my United Mileage Plus account number so I could get credit for the two short flights. I was told it was in my profile and even showed up on my two boarding passes for both flights. When a month went by and I did not see any credit in my UA Mileage Plus account for the two SIA flights, I contacted Mileage Plus to look into it. I was told by UA that I was not getting credit because my flights were in K class economy, and that was ineligible to get miles on United, even though SIA is a Star Alliance Partner. I then took my complaint to SIA who told me something I had never heard of ""when you book in K, V, Q or N Class you only get miles on SIA."" What? I flew on the plane, I paid for my ticket and SIA only gives miles for their Kris Flyer program? Lame, .stupid and unfair. Part of my flights to Singapore, part of my trip was on ANA and they gave me full mileage credit on UA Mileage Plus for the NRT-SIN leg. I will never fly Singapore Airlines again.",Business,December 2016,FRA to SIN,Economy Class,4,1,5,5,1,1,no
very impressed by Singapore Airlines,Viral Ladhani,2017-02-14,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Frankfurt to Singapore. Superb product! Right from boarding till reaching Changi. Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesn't allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it. They even fasten seat belts for passengers who were sleeping, never seen such care on another airline. Breakfast was served before landing and immigration cards were handed in time. At all times, crew were caring and meticulously dressed. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines and thier product. Definately my first option to Asia.

I have an email with my itinerary showing the flight is from Singapore to San Francisco. There are no words about a 1hr 30 mins stop in Hong Kong. Only today I realized the flight is through Hong Kong. If I had known that, I wouldn't choose this company at all.

service was slow and disappointing,S Claezer,2017-02-11,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Perth to Munich via Singapore. This is a review of the flight SQ328 from Singapore to Munich on 10th February. The ordeal started in Singapore. While the flight was not marked as delayed, the departure time had been pushed back by 35 minutes on the airport screens. When I inquired, the answer was that ""we are using the first available aircraft"". Nice indeed. Singapore Airlines obviously works under the premise that changing departure times because of missing aircraft does not mean a delay. The flight boarded in accordance with the displayed delayed departure time. However, once on board, nothing happened at the departure time. No announcements were made. After inquiring again, the captain condescended to make an announcement that he was waiting for other passengers to join the flight. When inquiring a 3rd time what additional time we would be looking at, I got told that the captain is unable to tell. After an estimated 15 additional passengers had come in during additional 45 minutes of waiting, the aircraft finally taxied out to the runway. However, while several other aircraft passed us and took off, we were sitting in a parking spot next to the runway. This time an announcement was made that we ""have a few aircraft ahead of us"" - after about 20 minutes, the captain told us that his flight plan had expired and the route to Munich had been closed because of the long time we waited for other passengers. The result was that we had to taxi back to the gate from which we had left, in order to get a new flight plan and refuel the aircraft. This exercise cost another hour. In summary, it may be justified to wait for connecting passengers from delayed flights. However, the captain should have communicated honestly and, in particular, never taxied out to the runway. It is unprofessional and proves utmost incompetence to do this without a robust flight plan. He could have easily obtained an adjusted flight plan while we were sitting at the gate waiting for the connecting passengers from delayed flights. His lack of planning and anticipation skills are very concerning from a passengers's view. What does the guy do if anything unforeseen happens in the air? To add to the picture, the aircraft was worn, old and super noisy. The service in the back of the cabin was slow and disappointing when compared to previous Singapore Airlines standards. This was the second encounter of disappointing Singapore Airlines service in four flights on my recent trip. Things seem to go south at Singapore Airlines. In general, I question the justification of SQ having a five star airline rating.",Business,February 2017,Singapore to Chennai,Economy Class,5,5,1,3,2,1,no
service was impeccable,Muthusamy Gabriel,2017-02-06,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Singapore to Chennai return. The outbound flight was excellent in terms of being on time, the inflight service was impeccable. The seafood that I normally order was very very good. The flight crew were friendly and helpful as I needed some help with ordering in flight duty free goods. On the return from Chennai to Singapore, the service during the flight was bad. The cabin crew with their robotic attitude were interested to finish the service as soon as possible, to disappear from sight. Other than that I do not have any complaint to make.",Solo Leisure,January 2017,Perth to Vientiane via Singapore,Business Class,4,5,5,3,5,8,yes
check the cost of your tickets,P Adams,2017-02-01,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Perth to Vientiane via Singapore. Beware the stopover with Singapore Airlines. My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us - myself and our 3 teenagers - decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra $437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This, when asked, amounted to about $30 each! So I won't be flying with Singapore Airlines again and suggest you check the cost of your tickets to see how much extra you will be paying to stayover",Family Leisure,January 2017,SYD to LHR via SIN,Economy Class,3,1,4,1,1,3,no
worth the extra ... I don't think so,W Larkham,2017-01-29,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.",Solo Leisure,January 2017,HND to SIN,Premium Economy,5,2,4,4,1,5,yes

PTVs are not the latest ones, no touchscreen but good picture quality. Good service, but cost cutting measures were too apparent. SIA used to gorgeously serve meals to economy passengers. Now, the big meal tray comes with only one small box of mains, another super tiny box of salad, one piece of cold bread and that's it. They also need to increase speed of in flight meal.

It's been nearly 5 years since I last flew SIA and although just a single flight so far, I was bitterly disappointed. A380 business class section was looking a bit tired, seats worn and not the standards I remember. The biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was, almost from start to finish. Yes, they got the service done, but there wasn't a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy, they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. I fly a lot of other airlines around Asia, and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times, things seem to have gone the other way for SIA.

Boeing 777-200 had an old interior,K Larrsen,2017-01-24,Singapore Airlines,False,Singapore to Copenhagen. I usually fly this route with Singapore Airlines and have found my satisfaction declining with their offer lately. There was over a one and a half hour delay to our departure with no apology from the captain or crew when we landed in Copenhagen. There was quite some turbulence on this flight and the plane appeared to be struck by lightning at one point which was also not commented on by the captain despite many passengers being visibly shaken by the experience. The Boeing 777-200 had an old interior with the entertainment system not working on my seat nor those of my two companions. The interiors of these planes are simply not up to standard for a 5-star airline and are well overdue for their scheduled upgrade.

the seats were spacious,M Sanders,2017-01-22,Singapore Airlines,True,"  I flew on Singapore Airlines (SQ) from Sydney to Chennai via Singapore last December. This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesn't mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crew's perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldn't mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesn't help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didn't also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and haven't had much issues with the Wifi. Overall, I would fly Singapore Airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more A350's being delivered.",Solo Leisure,January 2017,MEL to SIN,Economy Class,1,5,3,4,4,8,yes
told I didn't check in baggage,Christopher Pearce,2017-01-21,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Melbourne to Singapore. I have for the second time in 2 years lost my baggage. This time I arrived last night and my baggage never appeared on the carousel. I went to report it missing to be told that I didn't check in any baggage. I flew with two fellow workers who verified that I did (not sure why they didn't believe me) and I left my details. After numerous calls in the morning, I was told my baggage had turned up on another carousel at T3, and they would call me when it was being delivered. That was early this morning, it is now 4.30pm and I cannot get though to the ""hot line"" to check if they could give me an approximate time, no joy there either.

Attention to detail was incredible, food tasted and looked great and the seat (even though it was there 'old' seat) was so wide and comfortable it was great for lounging and sleeping.

little and infrequent information,Z Moden,2017-01-13,Singapore Airlines,True,Moscow to Sydney via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow to Singapore (A350 SQ361) leg. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. The airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened.

Boarding was orderly and in accordance to the boarding group indicated on the tickets. In Bangkok, the staff hold up clear signs indicating doors to use by premium passengers and economy passengers. The A330 was quite new and comfortable. The screen for the IFE is large and has plenty of movies and programmes available. Two options were available for meals and in both journeys, I got my choice of meal despite sitting in the last row. I opted for the red chicken curry for the outgoing flight and stir fried pork with fried rice for the return flight. Both delicious and portions adequate. Although the seats were in the last row, they were able to recline with some room to spare before hitting the wall. The toilets were near the last row of seats but they were positioned further back, toward the galley area. Cabin crew worked hard on this 2 hour flight with hot towels given at the beginning of the flight and a meal service with coffee/tea run after the meal. One thing useful is the foot pedal that is attached to the toilet trashbins. This is a feature I have not seen on some new planes of other airlines.

experience was a pleasant one,J Hamilton,2017-01-10,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Brisbane to Singapore and the experience was a pleasant one from the very first welcome. I am overjoyed that Singapore Airlines has reinstated the lager B777-200ER on this route especially in Business Class as it provides a 1-2-1 layout, with the long haul business class product rather than the 2-2-2 regional layout. The crew was very attentive and welcoming, taking meal orders before take off. Food was excellent as were drinks.On the overnight flight you have the choice of either a meal after take off or before landing. I choose mine after take off wanting to sleep. I was awake for breakfast and was offered the continental breakfast.

heaven compared to other airlines,G Bennett,2017-01-08,Singapore Airlines,False,"
Singapore Airlines new route Singapore - Canberra - Wellington - Canberra - Singapore. Flights to and from Singapore are overnight flights departing 23.00 from Singapore and midnight from Canberra to Singapore. Old plane but has 34 inch pitch in economy, heaven compared to other airlines 31-32 inches. Seats are quite firm but a good 19 inches wide. In both directions the meal is only a snack with a drink after takeoff, served really quickly to be able to turn the lights off. Extra drinks only on request. This allows Wellington passengers to get some sleep as they have already had a 3 hour flight to Canberra and a 1 hour transit. Breakfast is generous served with coffee and tea refills. The other bonus for this flight for Canberra residents is not having to get to Sydney or Melbourne and not having to deal with Sydney airport. For many Canberra residents it is only a fifteen minute drive to Canberra airport, check in is fast as it is the only flight out. With internet check in it is a bag drop. You can leave home two hours before take off and be in the departure lounge with time for a drink before boarding.",Couple Leisure,January 2017,AMS to SIN,Economy Class,5,5,3,4,5,8,yes
it was a great flight,C Overgoor,2017-01-07,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Amsterdam to Singapore. I was looking forward to fly the A350. After booking the flight I received an offer to upgrade to Premium Economy, but I rejected after reading a number of reviews. The flight was departing behind schedule due to passengers who did not turn up and a time consuming de-icing process. I am glad I did not take the Premium Economy upgrade offer. Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level.  Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that. Customer service was good (not exceptional) and the meals were delicious.  One of the best meals ever had on a plane. I appreciate the metal cutlery and hot towel cloths. Overall, it was a great flight and I am looking forward to the next one!

"polite, courteous and helpful",R Adriansyah,2017-01-06,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Singapore to Houston via Manchester. Flight left Singapore on time and cabin crew provided hot towel followed by drink and light supper after take off.  FAs patrol the cabin with water, juice and snack runs every 15-30 minutes and very helpful when I requested additional drinks. They turned the lights back on and started the hot towel, drinks and Breakfast service before we arrived in Manchester. Flight deck communication was adequate; we know we were ahead of schedule and can expect that Manchester is foggy and cold when we arrived. Entertainment system was a slightly older one without touch screen but still contains more than enough movies, TV series and games to keep passengers entertained. The flight left Manchester behind schedule but arrived on time in Houston. Fresh set of crew got on board from Manchester going to Houston. There is one FA that we knew from our previous flight 2 weeks back between SIN-CGK; back then she mentioned she'll be in this flight and she was! She was one of the better crew members in our past flight and her bright and cheerful personality shines through in this flight as well. Even though other FAs in this flight to Houston were also polite, courteous and helpful as expected, but most of them were not as personable and does not exude a warm personality in giving their service. Most of the FA on this flight tends to give mechanical service and you can feel that they are here to perform as expected, but missing the part where they should be able to engage their customers in a more personal way. However they did a great job in providing their services throughout the flight, keeping us full with three meal services and drink-snacks in between, also keeping the restrooms clean and well-stocked. Flight deck communications are adequate; we were informed about possible turbulences along the way so we can prepare, the time we will be arriving in Houston and also the local weather informations.",Family Leisure,December 2016,CGK to SIN,Economy Class,5,5,5,4,5,9,yes
provided quick lunch service,R Adriansyah,2017-01-06,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Jakarta to Singapore on the A350-900 (9V-SMD). Check-in was quick since we checked in online and arrived early. Flight left Jakarta slightly behind schedule but arrived on time in Singapore. Flight attendants provided quick lunch service and two drink runs in a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). Even though they were still very polite and courteous, the FA on this particular flight were not as energized or cheerful as other flights we were in. Entertainment system uses touchscreen system that is very easy to use with lots of choices. Restrooms were clean. Minimum communications from flight deck; we didn't get announcement on which terminal in Singapore we will arrive in and local weather conditions like they usually broadcast before arrival. We have a connecting flight in Singapore from Terminal 3, so I asked several FA for arrival information and they didn't know either. I finally got the informations I needed on arrival terminal (Terminal 2) after looking at the system generated flight informations in the entertainment system; and even informing the FA on this.",Family Leisure,December 2016,SIN to CGK,Economy Class,3,2,5,4,5,7,yes
A350 cabin bright and airy,R Adriansyah,2017-01-06,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Singapore to Jakarta on an A350-900 (9V-SMD). Flight left behind schedule. We waited for like 30+ minutes after scheduled departure time on ground in Singapore before push back to avoid getting trapped in air traffic congestion in Jakarta. Excellent communication from Flight Deck. Flight Attendants on this flight worked hard, providing lunch service with two drink runs on a full flight for such a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). FAs were very cheerful and polite. I pre-ordered in-flight merchandise (aircraft models) and they brought it to me before the flight lands. Aircraft was a new A350, the cabin was bright and airy. and large windows adding to a sense of space. Entertainment using the latest touchscreen which is very easy and fun to use.  Only gripe I had was one piece of our luggage was stranded in Singapore and didn't make it on our flight, but after checking with SQ baggage service person in Jakarta we were told that it will arrive on the next flight from Singapore 2.5 hours later. The issue with the delayed/misplaced bag happened most likely because we were connecting in Singapore an hour before this flight from our previous flight from Houston.",Family Leisure,December 2016,IAH to SIN via MAN,Economy Class,5,5,5,4,5,8,yes
overall an excellent flight,R Adriansyah,2017-01-05,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Houston to Singapore via Manchester on Boeing 77-300ER (9V-SWH). Check-in process at Houston Bush was just OK; they were not as fast or efficient as Qatar check-in next door. Houston to Manchester flight left relatively on time. Cabin Service was great, the FAs did quick hot towel, drinks and dinner service right after take off, and they also provided a birthday cake for my son as was requested. Good communication from the flight deck when there was turbulence coming up so everybody's prepared. Afterwards they dimmed the cabin lights so passengers can rest. FAs worked hard; they kept patrolling the cabin with water and juice runs every 15-30 minutes or so throughout the night, and occasional snack runs too (sandwiches, chocolate, fruits). Had breakfast before we landed, and arrived at Manchester ahead of schedule. Manchester to Singapore flight left behind schedule but they catch up and arrived on time in Singapore. Fresh set of crew from Manchester provided excellent service; the FA offered three meal services throughout the 13 hours flight (Breakfast, Lunch and light Supper) plus snack and drinks in between. We're kept full at all times with good food choices. Leading FA engaged me to ensure that my son had had his birthday cake as requested, even offering another one for this leg, which we politely refused (his birthday was already over!). Good communication from flight deck regarding arriving terminal and local weather. Cabin crew on both legs ensure that the restrooms were always cleaned and in pristine condition. Entertainment system was easy to use, a slightly older version without touch screen, and even though it may not have an obscenely extensive entertainment choice like Emirates, they have a large collection of movies and TV series including new releases that is more than enough to keep you entertained throughout both legs. Overall an excellent flight.

SQ have really dropped the ball,G Dodd,2017-01-05,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Melbourne to London return via Singapore. Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why I've given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines, especially if you are looking to fly premium economy.",Couple Leisure,January 2017,SFO to SIN,Premium Economy,4,3,5,4,1,3,no
A350 makes flights easy,B Halide,2017-01-04,Singapore Airlines,False,"  San Francisco to Singapore. A good experience on Singapore Airlines with a few hiccups. We got the middle seat to ourselves in economy which made the 16.5 hour journey quite pleasant. The nicest part of this flight is the actual aircraft. The A350 makes such non stop flights easy on the body. A plus for Singapore Airlines for including this in their fleet. Service standards are good, but quite often I feel that SQ have a pretty rushed and least patient service on the San Francisco route. The cabin was overall clean but there was some muck above my window which I had to clean. Biggest disappointment was when I asked for the Singapore immigration card and the crew member told me they hadn't brought any on the flight. 2 hours later another crew member started offering them. An apology for the error was not forthcoming which was the actual annoyance.",Couple Leisure,December 2016,WLG to CBR,Economy Class,4,4,5,4,4,8,yes
flight attendants were exceptionally friendly,M Atkins,2017-01-04,Singapore Airlines,False,"  An excellent flight with Singapore Airlines from Wellington to Canberra. The flight attendants were exceptionally friendly, professional and attentive. The food was also very good. The seat was perfectly adequate for the three hour flight and looked ok for an overnight service. If I did have one complaint, it would be that the cabin was uncomfortably warm. The flight left on time, arrived early and I was out the front door of Canberra airport ten minutes after touch down, a great new option between the capital cities that I look forward to using on a regular basis.

not fly again long haul,E Hawes,2017-01-02,Singapore Airlines,False,"  London to Singapore return, and the Premium Economy experience was very poor. Despite booking some months in advance, they neglected to allocate us any seats together and our party of 4 was distributed throughout the cabin. The seat configuration is 2-4-2 and there are no toilets specifically for Premium Economy. Rather than a separate cabin curtained off, Premium Economy is just the front section of the economy section. The seats were functional and inflight entertainment good but seat pitch is less than Air NZ. The food was terrible. We used the ""book the cook"" option on the return flight and this was no better, though they did manage to accomodate an allergy in our group. The staff were unfriendly and snacks on the 14 hour flight (2 meals were offered, the second 6 hours before arrival) had to be requested via the call button. The flight arrived early and the plane was quite new but would not fly Singapore Airlines again long haul.

make sure to read all 20 pages of T&Cs,L Andrews,2017-01-02,Singapore Airlines,True," Melbourne to London via Singapore. If you book on line make sure to read all 20 pages of the Terms and Conditions. I have been an Elite Gold KrisFlyer member for 15 years and have previously considered Singapore Airlines as one of my preferred airlines. Not any more. All I wanted to do was buy an Economy Class ticket and use points to upgrade to business class (my daughter was the passenger). So I went on line and selected the cabin class that allowed upgrades. The web site showed a tick that this was possible and the ticket that I subsequently purchased likewise confirmed that class E tickets are eligible for upgrades. What they don't tell you is that upgrades are only permissible to the next available cabin class and that as most international flights have a Premium Economy cabin you can not upgrade from regular economy to business class. This little known rule is buried deep in the terms and conditions (section F, para 24, sub section a)) which almost nobody ever reads, it is 20+ pages long. And if you want your money back then there is a $200 cancellation fee.

magnitude of change inexcusable,R Chungtar,2016-12-31,Singapore Airlines,False,"  New York to Chiang Mai return via Singapore booked for March 2017. Days after making the reservation well in advance (through Orbitz), I was notified of a minor change in schedule. No problem. A couple of days later I received another change, this one a 22 hour flight delay requiring almost a full extra day of travel spent in Singapore. Singapore Airlines policy gave me these choices: Accept the change (ridiculous), or provide them with 3 alternatives in order of preference. They then choose which one you will fly. The passenger cannot choose and have that choice confirmed. Or cancel the ticket (full refund) and start over. In this case, no other same-day flight Singapore to Chiang Mai was available, so the alternatives reduced to an extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 2 hours, or extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 4 hours, or connection through Hong Kong and losing approximately 15 hours in transit. But if you say okay to these choices ""you could end up with any one of them"", and all are inferior to the original reservation. I cancelled, and will not be booking this airline again. This magnitude of change is inexcusable and the subsequent policy absurd.",Solo Leisure,December 2016,SIN to AKL,Economy Class,5,4,5,5,1,1,no

The seats were ok but, when the person in front reclined their seats, we could not move. My husband's seat in fact was broken. The service was terrible - the worst I have experienced in 45 years of travelling. The food was awful and service was too rushed. The staff were unfriendly.

cost cutting in economy class meals,Steve Siauw,2016-12-30,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Tokyo to Jakarta via Singapore. Exceptional, but not in a good way. Missed connecting flight to Jakarta due to afternoon typhoon in Singapore. Plane from Tokyo landed in Batam, Indonesia instead, flew back to Singapore in three hours. Same issue happened once due to technical problem, but apparently SIA always tries their best not to compensate me with business class seats, even though I missed my flight because of their problems and I have been their gold member for 4 years now. I was compensated only with another economy class seat and SGD 15 meal voucher that I can only redeem at limited number of food outlets at Changi airport, and most of them are too random (food not looking good at all). They have been also been doing this cost cutting in the economy class meals by not giving appetizers anymore. FAs never happy when I order some special drinks even though they are on the menu. If SIA wants to do some cost cutting or what not, they should have made it less obvious, especially to loyal customers, otherwise loyal customers will look for other cost-effective Star Alliance carriers. Their ticket price for the same route is a lot more expensive compared to some other Star Alliance such as ANA and Asiana Airlines.",Solo Leisure,December 2016,SIN to SGN,Economy Class,2,5,4,4,3,6,no
very impressive performance,Robert Hamilton,2016-12-27,Singapore Airlines,True,"  First time I've flown with Singapore Airlines and they didn't let us down. Flew from Sydney to Colombo via Singapore. Although we were in economy the aircraft was clean, ground crew and cabin crew were friendly and attentive throughout and food and entertainment were fine. The seat on the return leg on the upper deck of the A380 was so comfortable I had to be woken for breakfast. It was on the return leg that this airline really impressed me. At Singapore there was a technical problem with the A380 slotted to fly us back to Sydney. We were advised immediately and reallocated to another gate where within an hour, the entire passenger list was boarded onto another A380 and we departed 1 hour late. Who has a 'spare' A380 with flight crew ready to go with passengers boarded in 60 minutes? They also made up the time and landed us in Sydney ahead of schedule by about 5 minutes. This is a very impressive performance and one that some other airlines might seek to emulate. We flew Air New Zealand to San Francisco in May and a technical fault in Sydney saw us trapped in the airport for 8 hours, miss our connection in Auckland and lose a day out of our trip. No-one should be blamed for technical problems but the rude and unprofessional manner in which ground staff at Sydney airport managed passenger enquiries was unparalleled in my 44 years of flying. We will never fly with Air New Zealand again. We will fly with Singapore Air.",Business,November 2016,AKL to SIN,Economy Class,4,5,5,3,5,10,yes
a great way to fly,Eugene Tan,2016-12-20,Singapore Airlines,True," Auckland to Singapore. Singapore Airlines Business Class is the best you can fly. The food selection is extensive and delicious. There are many beverages to choose from, good selection of wine. The cabin crew are attentive, and they feed you well. The seat can be transformed into a bed that is comfortable to sleep during the long flight. There is a wide selection of movies that I had to make the tough choice of sleeping 40,000 feet in the air or watching the very nice movies with noise-cancelling headphones. I enjoyed my flight thoroughly and would love to fly with Singapore Airlines again. Certainly a great way to fly.",Couple Leisure,December 2016,LHR to SIN,Business Class,4,5,3,5,5,10,yes
worst ever experience flying,Molly Watt,2016-12-19,Singapore Airlines,True,"  I flew from Heathrow to Singapore then Denpasar to Singapore to Heathrow. My outward flight was appalling. I am a deafblind traveller, the airline was advised of my condition and requirements by both my travel agent and my mother. On boarding the aircraft with my cane I was told where my seat was, and nothing else. I had no access to safety instructions or menus. No access to entertainment system, no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. I did not know how my chair worked. I was completely ignored on the outbound flight. A complaint was made and I was advised my return flight I would be made comfortable, that I would have my needs taken into account. This was not the case, again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. Singapore Airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make ""reasonable adjustments"" to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. I could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. I could not use the toilets as I wasn't told where they are. The crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort. I was denied access to all inflight entertainment and felt unable to leave my seat for 13 hours. This is totally unacceptable. Singapore Airlines have acknowledged their errors but not offered appropriate compensation - an absolute disgrace.

Legroom is comparable with other good economy class airlines, but they are wider which makes a difference. They are comfortable, everything works - meals, drink service, food service, punctuality. Singapore Airlines can make a reasonably good economy experience by being friendly, attentive and active when serving customers. Even the food was good for economy, while maintaining simplicity. It was 24 hours from Melbourne to Amsterdam and I don't feel tired or washed out on arrival - had a good sleep on both legs. It's worth that little extra expense and Singapore Airport is the best to kill time in.

high standard of service,Jinwei Zuo,2016-11-15,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Flew Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Singapore. Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one. I found the IFE content rich and diverse, especially the music library - I enjoy listening to music while watching the moving-maps. I didn't use the WiFi, thus unable to comment. The flight attendants patrolled the cabin two to three times between meals with professional manner and meticulous grooming. All in all, this flight demonstrated Singapore Airlines high standard of service.",Solo Leisure,September 2016,SIN to BNE,Economy Class,5,5,1,5,5,8,yes
use such old dated cabin,D Fernando,2016-11-15,Singapore Airlines,True,"  Singapore to Brisbane. I am a star alliance gold member for the last 4 years and regular traveler on this sector. Recently Singapore Airlines has decided to replace the regular A330 service with an older much worse Boeing 777-200ER service. I am surprised they would use such old dated cabin in this aircraft, my main concern is the poor qaulity entertainment screen, also the poor meal service now converted to a brunch and every poor standard, better meal served on budget airlines. There was no drinks service before the meals. I hope they review this and revert back to regular A330 service.",Solo Leisure,November 2016,AMS to MEL via SIN,Economy Class,4,3,4,5,2,4,no
the PTV really let me down,A Freeman,2016-11-10,Singapore Airlines,False,"  Istanbul to Sydney via Singapore. First time I had flown Singapore Airlines in over 25 years and I had very high expectations. First impression was that the interior looked clean but slightly dated. The seats were comfortable but the armrests didn't come all the way up - which was annoying. Had 3 seats to myself on one flight but couldn't stretch/sleep due to the arms rests. Legroom was above average at 32 inches and much appreciated. The individual TV was very old and screen quality was poor. The cheap headphones meant that the sound was fuzzy and after 30 mins I gave up. This was the case on all 4 long haul flights. Very disappointing. Selection was average. Compared to Emirates or Turkish Airlines it was remarkably bad. Even the moving map was ancient. Needs massive improvement. Service was excellent through the flight. Crew very polite and proactive. Food / drinks were generally good. Asian dishes were excellent and they gave me a second hot meal on request. Icecream for dessert was fun. Snacks were also provided as were drinks between meals. Steel cutlery was appreciated. Hot towel service is excellent. Toilets were always kept clean with nice amenities. They were also larger than on other airlines. All in all, I was really looking forward to a 5 Star experience but the PTV really let me down. Ruined the flight given I had over 38 hours flying time on this trip and had been really looking forward to seeing some movies / tv etc. With the new economy seats, Singapore Airlines will be a 5 star product but without them they are barely 3.5.",Solo Leisure,November 2016,DEL to SIN,Economy Class,4,5,5,4,3,6,yes

From updating a companion's passport details through their reservations line in Manila to the orderly boarding procedure, one gets a sense of the quality. The meals, particularly the pork pasta dish served on the Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore sector, were divine. The frequent drinks run was very highly appreciated. The cabin staff were efficient and effective, particularly with regard to safety, with polite but firm requests to stow bags and trays when necessary.

marginally superior to Economy,Antony Champion,2016-10-24,Singapore Airlines,True,"  In September / October 2016 I flew with my wife around the world using in sequence Virgin Atlantic, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines. All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service. ",Couple Leisure,October 2016,SYD to HND via SIN,Premium Economy,5,5,1,3,1,1,no
space is paramount for my flying experience,James Roussell,2016-10-21,Singapore Airlines,False,"  I recently flew from Sydney to Tokyo via Singapore in economy class. This was my first time flying Singapore Airlines, and I had high expectations. I am tall, 6 foot 5 inches, so space is paramount for my flying experience to be comfortable. Sadly SQ lacks this. I had 4 different versions of the B777 on this trip, and I found the newer the aircraft, the less space there was between seats. Food was ok, and service was great. Cabins seemed unclean. If you're travelling in Economy, don't expect a great experience, as it seems SQ only cares for it top dollar paying business class passengers. Will stick to my usual choices of Qantas and Garuda Indonesia in the future.",Solo Leisure,October 2016,JFK to FRA,Economy Class,5,2,5,4,4,5,no
disappointed how this was handled,Petra Hublot,2016-10-19,Singapore Airlines,True,"  I had a delayed flight from Tampa (on JetBlue), scheduled initially at 4.30pm but delayed to 5.06pm in taking off at 5.35 pm to JFK with a connection flight to Frankfurt on Singapore Airlines at 8.55pm which I of course, missed by the time I got to the other Terminal and through security. I was stranded at JFK a bit after 9.00pm because at the counter at the gate was no one anymore and the tiny booth is only occupied a few hours at odd hours per day. So I called the 1-800 # on my booking confirmation and was told that they would put me on the very next flight at 8.55am, yes the person said am! But as all offices are closed now I will get a confirmation call once they open the next morning! Learned later that they are in San Francisco, 3 hours behind us. So I went back to the other Terminal to the help desk of JetBlue, which had the delayed plane - after more than an hour with several phone calls I finally got a room in an hotel for the night, I finally made it after midnight into my room. The next morning I rushed to the Airport only to learn that there is no am flight ! The flight is apparently daily at 8.55 pm. I couldn't believe what I was told on the phone. I already spent a short night without my luggage or personal belongings and fresh clothes and now I had to sit another 12 hours around. Once the booth from Singapore Airline was occupied at 2.55 pm I told them about my dilemma and he called his supervisor to find out if I could reschedule my flight back from FRA, Germany to JFK : instead of Oct. 03, 2016 to one or two days later because of my lost 24 hours here at the Airport. Nope, nothing to do, because I already have gotten an hotel room for the night ! Unbelievable, I would have slept in a corner at the Airport they would have rescheduled my flight back home?  I didn't even get to choose after this ordeal, really? It's a shame that the company is not more flexible or willing to do more for these kind of situations. I'm very disappointed how this was handled.",Solo Leisure,October 2016,SGN to MEL via SIN,Economy Class,3,3,4,4,4,7,yes
not a great deal of consistency,B Leeson,2016-10-18,Singapore Airlines,True," Ho Chi Minh city to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Wow there really is - I discovered - not a great deal of consistency with SQ apart from the service routine. HCMC to Singapore I had the best meal on a flight ever. Tender pork in gravy with thin sliced fried potato and onion. Was so good. The entertainment was appalling in that the screen was too dark to even see, even with lighting altered and the screen tilted, blinds down. Anyway we got there safely and being just a 2 hr flight it was fine. Leaving Singapore on SQ 227 at 9.20pm. Full flight. Going through security at the gate itself. Boarded in sections but no one abided by that and they were not enforced which makes for a shambles. Paid for exit row seats. Nowhere to store anything. My husband tried to find an overhead locker but the lady in the aisle two seats down refused to share. Her carry on was horizontal in it and she had another small bag. Got upset when my husband tried to put her bag vertical. Was ignored by FAs. Found somewhere finally, but if you do go for the exit row you will be last off as you can't get back to where your bag is. Nowhere for my handbag. I got it stuffed under my own seat via the front. There was a baby in the infant seats but was really good, very attentive parents, I was impressed. Singapore has got the meal service wrong here too. At 9.20pm you are faced with a proper dinner which a snack would suffice as most have had dinner by then. Breakfast was a roll, muffin and a little bit of fruit. After having such a great experience on the initial trip I felt let down. Still quite good but I felt I could have been with any other airline. I wish there was more consistency. I would still opt for them though at least outbound.",Couple Leisure,October 2016,MEL to SIN,Economy Class,3,3,3,3,4,7,yes
